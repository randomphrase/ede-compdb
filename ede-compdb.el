;;; Commentary:

;; EDE-compdb is a library that enables the Emacs Development Environment (EDE),
;; to be used with a compilation database, as provided by build tools such as
;; CMake or Ninja.  This enables CEDET to be automatically configured for use to
;; support parsing, navigation, completion, and so on.  This is especially useful
;; for C and C++ projects which are otherwise quite tricky to configure for use
;; with CEDET and other libraries.
;; 
;; See the documentation at https://github.com/randomphrase/ede-compdb for
;; quickstart and usage information
